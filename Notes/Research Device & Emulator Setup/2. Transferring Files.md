# adb push

To transfer files between our computer and the device, we use the commands adb push and adb pull.

```
adb push <local_file_on_computer> <target_path_on_device>
```

With `adb push` we can push a file or a directory from our computer to the device. We have to specify a destination path - a common one is `/sdcard/`, which is not an external SD-card, but generally mounts to the internal storage of the device.

Example to push test.png from the Desktop to the Download folder of the device:

```bash
adb push Desktop/test.png /sdcard/Downloads/
```

# adb pull

```bash
adb pull <file_path_on_device> [<optional_target path_on_the_computer>]
```

With `adb pull` we can pull files from the device to the computer. For example, to download the entire Download folder from the device, we can use:

```
adb pull /sdcard/Downloads
```

This will store Downloads in your current directory.

Note that with `adb pull` we can only access the files we have access to with `adb shell`, and so you will find that you can not download a lot of application files this way.

# Android Studio Device Explorer

Android Studio has an integrated Device Explorer, which allows us to explore the device storage with a nice UI.
